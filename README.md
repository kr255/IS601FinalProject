# IS601FinalProject

This marks the end of IS601. The final project entailed following Creating Your First Flask Application(https://hackersandslackers.com/your-first-flask-application).

-------  
## Things to Consider

Since I cant read directions I failed to create branches for each step of the tutorial but created a commit for each step.
As a result I will timestamp each step with a commit id plus the word document with pictures of the project running at various steps.

#### Instead of branches I did commits, I made the mistake of reaching branches as commits in the directions. However, I can assure you I tried my best to follow the tutorial in the grace period awarded by the professor. Will follow it thoroughly after submitting. 

0c707099626e1b86c582e139ea42a2a7a51b6f5c: First Step of the tutorial

cf1707f02820f5112aad4f927fc7c0364caee663: Second Step of the tutorial - Rendering Pages in Flask Using Jinja

9f4bf10982b8d545ae26839e05706c3ad3227928: Step 3, 4, 5. Skipped step 6, 7, 8(Step 8 later added for Step 10)

I was short on time since the semester was very small, I commented out the code that was giving errors instead of properly refactoring it. I am really sorry for which. 

Please check the screenshots in the word document for additional verification of my attempt. 


The project is containerized, Dockerfile installs the required dependencies, copies the project to /app directory and exposes port 5000. 

To run, one can clone the project. Open it up in Pycharm, create a run config using the docker.yml file and run it. 
To run different parts of the projects, please revert to the appropriate commit. 

As for the last commit (395beaafa9340cd168318cfeb928e34a0f68a529) the registration and login process are working.

# Take aways from the last project and the class.

I wish I had taken this class in a regular semester. It would of been even more beneficial to me in my career. 

#### To do after initial submit
Refactor the code to make all steps work with each other
Add a travis build file for build succession badge
Expand upon the db, instead of sqllite, use mysql.
